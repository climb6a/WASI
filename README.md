## General info
The Water Colour Simulator **WASI** is a tool for the simulation of optical properties and light field parameters of deep and shallow waters, and for data analysis of spectrometers disposed above the water surface and submerged in the water. The module WASI-2D allows image processing of atmospherically corrected data from multi- and hyperspectral airborne sensors and satellite instruments.

## Setup
Installation of version 5.1:
* Execute **INSTALL_WASI5_1.EXE** 
* Alternately, unzip **WASI5_1.ZIP** to directory
* Check installation directory **D:/WASI5.1**. If the file WASI5.1.EXE is in an other directory, either change the directory, or replace in WASI5_1.INI all occurences of *D:\WASI5.1* with the installation directory.

Installation of beta version 5.2:
* Install version 5.1
* Replace WASI5_1.EXE with WASI5_2.EXE
* Rename WASI5_1.INI to WASI5_2.INI

## Major files and subdirectories
* WASI5_1.EXE, the executable file
* WASI5_1.INI, initialisation file
* ./DAT, directory with input spectra and demo data
* ./DOC, directory documentation
