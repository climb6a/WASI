## General info
The Water Colour Simulator **WASI** is a tool for the simulation of optical properties and light field parameters of deep and shallow waters, and for data analysis of instruments disposed above the water surface and submerged in the water. Supported measurements are downwelling irradiance, upwelling radiance, irradiance reflectance, remote sensing reflectance, attenuation, and absorption. Data analysis is done by inverse modeling. The provided database, which covers the spectral range from 350 to 1000 nm in 1 nm intervals, can be exchanged easily to represent the studied area. The module WASI-2D extends the functionality towards image processing of atmospherically corrected data from airborne sensors and satellite instruments.
